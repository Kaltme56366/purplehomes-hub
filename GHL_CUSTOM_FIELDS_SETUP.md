## Overview

Purple Homes uses GHL custom fields to store and display property data, buyer preferences, and deal information. These fields must be created in your GHL account with the **exact field keys** specified below.

### Field Key Naming Convention

- Field keys are **case-insensitive** but should use **snake_case** (e.g., `property_beds`)
- The field key is what appears in the API, not the display name
- Always use the exact field key specified - typos will cause data mapping failures
